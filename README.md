# WebPractice2
Website for web development practice. All the pictures and graphics used here are from online free psd files which I am just using to practice with for learning purposes only.
If anyone likes to make any commits or modifications or leave any comments please do, the whole reason behind these projects is for learning and the reason I am posting it here is to try to learn as much as I can from anyone and help anyone in my shoes who is seeking to learn as well.

(18-06-2016) At this point the website still needs its footer and after that needs to be responsive. Maybe a few jquery cool animations as well.
